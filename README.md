# N-body Pendulum
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ada7c15c-5e7a-439c-9e82-7960a29c1e3d
# How to Build?
`git submodule init`  
`git submodule update`  
`cmake -B build`  
`cmake --build build --target all`  
# How to use?
In build folder, run `Pendulum` executable. After that, pendulum from `build/examples/input.txt` is loaded.  
input.txt structure:  
`DeltaTime multiplayer`  
`Camera coordinates (x, y, z)`  
`Camera angle (2 values)`  
`Number of Pendulums`
`Number of moving nodes for each pendulum`
`For each pendulum, for each moving node:`
* `Initial angle`
* `Initial angular velocity`
* `Node mass`
* `Length of node's line`

`WASD` can be use to move camera  
arrows can be used to rotate camera  
`R` reloades pendulum from file
`T` starts/stops simulation
